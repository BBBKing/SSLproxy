.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The file sslproxy.conf configures SSLproxy, sslproxy(1).
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
The file consists of comments and options with arguments. Each line which starts with a hash (\fB#\fR) symbol is ignored by the parser. Options and arguments are of the form \fBOption Argument\fR. The arguments are of the following types:

.TP 
\fBSTRING\fR
String.
.TP 
\fBNUMBER\fR
Unsigned integer.
.SH "DIRECTIVES"
.LP 
When an option is not used (hashed or doesn't exist in the configuration file) sslproxy takes a default action.
.TP 
\fBCACert STRING\fR
Use CA cert (and key) to sign forged certs.
.TP
\fBCAKey STRING\fR
Use CA key (and cert) to sign forged certs.
.TP
\fBCAChain STRING\fR

.TP
\fBCRL STRING\fR
Use URL as CRL distribution point for all forged certs.

Write leaf key and only generated certificates to gendir.
.TP
\fBWriteAllCertsDir STRING\fR
Write leaf key and all certificates to gendir.
.TP
\fBDenyOCSP BOOL\fR
Deny all OCSP requests on all proxyspecs.

.TP 
\fBContentLogDir STRING\fR
Content log: full data to separate files in dir (excludes ContentLog/ContentLogPathSpec).
.TP 
\fBContentLogPathSpec STRING\fR
Content log: full data to sep files with %% subst (excludes ContentLog/ContentLogDir).
.TP 
\fBLogProcInfo BOOL\fR
